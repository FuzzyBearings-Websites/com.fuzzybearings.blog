preface: Are you date-oriented or do you prefer organizing your work via <a href="http://www.everydaykanban.com/what-is-kanban/">kanban</a>. If so, do you find that to be enough or would you also like to see your stories in the form of a <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/user-story-map">story map</a>? Well never fear, have we got something for you!

In true lean spirit, I'm close to finishing up a prototype of a **kanban** representation for the iPhone. Once I can add and edit stories I'll port the same to the iPad before starting down the **story mapping** path.

*A few thoughts on where I'm headed for the MVP:*

### Landing Screen

- initially, the landing screen will simply display a list of active and inactive projects
- you will be able to add and delete projects as well as move projects between the two extremes

### Kanban Board

- select project from the **Landing Screen** and you'll be taken to a kanban board
- the kanban board for release 1 will be a simple table view where sections map to kanban columns and rows map to stories
- kanban columns can be customized

### Story Detail

- select a story from the kanban board and you'll be taken to the story detail screen
- for the first release, story details will consist mostly of name and description fields
- stories will be sortable
