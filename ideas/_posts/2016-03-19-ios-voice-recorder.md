title: iOS Voice Recorder
author: LB
preface: Have you longed for a better voice recorder on your iPhone? What does that voice recorder look like? I would like a voice recorder that automatically saves recordings to a cloud provider like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a> or <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/">One Drive</a> so that I can immediately access them in an arbitrary way from arbitrary locations.

I drive 1.5 hours to and from work everyday and have acculumated quite a collection of random thoughts, song ideas, agile rants and odd observations in my iPhone voice recorder. Unfortunately, I don't always have time or remember to sync my device and then go into iTunes, find where they are hiding the voice memos and drag them to my shared cloud drive. So, if I want to listen to or navigate through my audible notes, I generally have my iPhone. Needless to say, this doesn't scale well. More specifically, I'd much rather prefer to go to my DropDox drive and play them directly.

There are a few apps in the app store that manage recordings but from my perspective, they look dated or over-done. I just want a simple way to record and organize recordings.

*So, a few thoughts on what would make an ideal recorder for me:*

### Main Screen

- I think interface should resemble Google's [Inbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inbox-by-gmail-new-email-app/id905060486?mt=8) application. The main screen would display a list of recordings in reverse chronological order.

### Recording

- I'd like a button on the main screen to immediately begin a new recording.

### Organization

- After a successful recording session I'd like to be prompted to *tag* the recording and/or add a title.

### Storage

- Once the recording has been saved, it should sync with the cloud provider whenever possible. Files won't have to stay on the device but could - there will need to be some user-based discretion. In any case, the device should be able to access any recording hosted in the cloud.
