Like peanut butter and chococolate, I need a [storymapping](http://www.agileproductdesign.com/presentations/user_story_mapping/) tool to go along with my kanban board. More specifically, I'd like to organize stories in terms of use cases so I can:

- understand (and contain) the _big picture_
- make better decisions (pick more appropriate stories) for each work iteration

I'm currently using a spreadsheet to simulate the effect but it is arduous and doesn't scroll or size dynamically like I want it to. My next step will be to sketch out a rough skeleton of how I might do this on an iPad and then spike on an implementation of something like a [UICollectionView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UICollectionView_class/).
