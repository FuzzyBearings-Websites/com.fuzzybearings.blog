title: iOS Storymapping Tool
author: LB
preface: Can you imagine organizing your projects via <a href="http://jpattonassociates.com/user-story-mapping/">Storymapping</a>? Do you long for a tool that allows you to create, associate, and track goals, activities, user narrative, and story level details? I could certainly use such a tool in my day to day. I've seen a few services (<a href="https://cardboardit.com/">CardboardIT</a>, <a href="http://storiesonboard.com/">Stories On Board</a>) but I haven't come across anything tailored fort the iPad. I personally want to find a way to integrate a storymapping tool with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">kanban board</a>. And for extra-credit, I'd like to visualize user stories on the kanban board in terms of use cases!

Like peanut butter and chococolate, I need a [storymapping](http://www.agileproductdesign.com/presentations/user_story_mapping/) tool to go along with my kanban board. More specifically, I'd like to organize stories in terms of use cases so I can:

- understand (and contain) the _big picture_
- make better decisions (pick more appropriate stories) for each work iteration

I'm currently using a spreadsheet to simulate the effect but it is arduous and doesn't scroll or size dynamically like I want it to. My next step will be to sketch out a rough skeleton of how I might do this on an iPad and then spike on an implementation of something like a [UICollectionView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UICollectionView_class/).
